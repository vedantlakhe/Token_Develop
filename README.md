# Solidity_Develop
This course was designed to introduce some basic concepts of Web3 and aso about the Blockchain with solidity programming.There have a module base learning method which are really effective.Now, for a submission, there is challenge to get all these things to work and the challenge is to make my own token.

## Challenge Description

I have created a contract with tha name as mytoken in that I used string and uint variable : for strings  I gave a name as  token named "ved" abbreviated as "v". There is the record of its total supply. And if someone mints some "v" tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also if someone burns those tokens, it will get subtracted from the total supply.

### Install

* I just used here the Online Remix IDE for implementation of  the solidity code with the version (0.8.18).
* Then I created a file in this repository named vedant_contract.sol it available in my github library.

### Code Flow

* If you are using Remix IDE.
* You can simply compile the code from the side menu.
* After compiling, you have to deploy the Contract from the side bar itself.
* And after deploying you have to enter certain inputs that the Smart Contract requires for minting and burning the tokens and also for checking the balance (all value shows down).

## Help

I suggest explore this Metacrafters academy Platform to build-up own skills.
